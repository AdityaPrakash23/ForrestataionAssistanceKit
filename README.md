Before you work with these files, to make more sense, please go through the below links for a better understanding of the Qorc-Sdk. They will help get started with the SDK, use it with the Quickfeather board and how to add an external I2C sensor to your project, and then how to use it with SensiML's software suite.

The Modified files folder contains the files that have been modified and need to be replaced or simply put in specific directories of your own qf_ssi_ai_app folder.

The provided zip file has my own project folder for the Data Recognition phase. Please use it as a reference as to what changes you need to make to your own project folder.

Also the executables here are for data recognition(`qf_ssi_ai_app_recog.bin`) and data collection (`qf_ssi_ai_app_col.bin`). You can use this to try out my test case.
